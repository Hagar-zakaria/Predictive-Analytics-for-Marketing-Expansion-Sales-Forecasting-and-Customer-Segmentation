# Data Preparation

### Importing Necessary Libraries

First, import the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
import joblib
```

## Load dataset using full path
Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.

```python
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
```

## Display the first few rows of the dataset

```python
data.head()
```

## Checking for missing values
Check for and handle missing values to ensure a clean dataset.

```python
data.isnull().sum()
```

## Drop rows with missing values (if any)
data.dropna(inplace=True)

## Convert categorical variables to numerical
data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)

# Data Transformation
Convert categorical variables into numerical ones for machine learning models.
